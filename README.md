# SA based FPGA placer
The implementation of a simulated annealing based standard-cell placement tool.

### Objective
![floorplan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15523357/28557837-9f456f8e-70c3-11e7-8dcc-da1d90a1557b.png)

Each space which can be occupied by a cell is referred as a cell site. There are nx sites and ny rows. The problem is to design a tool to place each cell of a circuit on the floor-plan while following any given design rules, which are discussed in the next section.

### Design Rules
* All the cells in a circuit are squares and have the same size(same height and width).
* We cannot assign more than one cell to each site/space on the floor-plan.
* The routing channel is of the same height as a row of cells.
* The distance between two cells is measured from the center of one cell to the center of the other.
* No extra artificial penalties are given for a net which crosses a row.
* The product of nx* ny should be at least as large as the number of cells in the circuit.

### Requirements
In order to run the program, the user is required to have the following modules installed:
* Python 3.x
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

### Pseudocode
The basic pseudocode for the placement tool is given below:
```
1: select circuit
2: set initial placement
3: set initial temperature and iterations
4: While not exit condition do
5:    For k iterations do
6:        select cells to swap
7.            Calculate new cost
8.            Calculate deltaC = New cost - Old cost
9.        if(deltaC <0)
10.           Accept the solution
11.       Else:
12.           R = rand(0,1)
13.           if(R< eâˆ’deltaC/T )then
14.               Accept the solution
16.           Else
17.               Reject solution
18.       End if
19.   End for
20.   Update T
21.   Update net criticality
22.End while
```
